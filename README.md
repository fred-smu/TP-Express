TP Search and Price Application


This is an app designed to let you create or update a login.
Once you login the system will do 2 API calls and pull the 1st 3 produts that are returned from Wallmart and Amiazon.
This data will display in one of 6 cards for you to see 
1)if the item is available
2)price of the item at the time of the pull.

For exaple, you log in without setting up a login, you will not be able to access the app.
Once you set up a login and password, you will be alowed to login and then see the price and other data we pulled from the vendors

You'll need the bootstrap CDN for CSS, jQuery, Popper.js, and jQuery's slim build. It's usually best to copy and paste the Starter Page example that they provide.
