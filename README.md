TP Search and Price Application


This is an app designed to let you create or update a login.
Once you login the system will do 2 API calls and pull the 1st 3 produts that are returned from Wallmart and Amiazon.
This data will display in one of 6 cards for you to see 
1)if the item is available
2)price of the item at the time of the pull.

For exaple, you log in without setting up a login, you will not be able to access the app.
Once you set up a login and password, you will be alowed to login and then see the price and other data we pulled from the vendors

Prerequisites

This is a list of things you need to use the software and how to install them:

Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/
You'll need the bootstrap CDN for CSS, jQuery, Popper.js, and jQuery's slim build. It's usually best to copy and paste the Starter Page example that they provide.
